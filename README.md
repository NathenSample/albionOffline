This is the source repository for the Albion Offline discord bot - If you are looking to add the bot to your server, then you can do so by visiting. [This Link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=622384942755610624&scope=bot&permissions=3072).

Once the bot has joined your server, verify that the `Albion Offline` role can view the channel, and then have any user with the "Administrator", "Manage Server" or "Manage Channel" Discord permissions, enable the bot by sending `@status toggle` to the channel you would like to recieve updates. Repeat these steps for any other channels you would like to receive notifications.
